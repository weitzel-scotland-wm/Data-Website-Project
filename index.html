        <p>Our world is on the fast track becoming digitalized. Music, books, art, photographs, communication, movies, and VIDEO GAMES. Video games are very quickly becoming digitalized. Is it for the better? Who knows, but there is a very interesting trend that I've noticed for the past few years. Less and less hard copies of video games are making it to store shelves, but the online video game platform, Steam, doesn't seem to be hindered at all. Now there could be a multitude of reasons why digital game distribution is more successful and viable in today's world. One, there is virtually unlimited supply: all companies have to do is make a copy of the game at no expense and sell it to a consumer. Two, it's easier for consumers to just download a game from home than go to their choice retailer and buy a hard copy. This switch can be seen in the lowering revenue of hard copy video games in the US and the growing popularity of Steam.</p>

        <p>As you can see, hard copy revenue in the US peaks in 2008 with 12 billion dollars in revenue! Although, this is also the year Steam becomes very popular. Due to a massive overhaul of the user interface and Steam Store library, users note that Steam is actually easy and fun to use (whereas before, they were displeased with the entire service). A large influx of new users join steam and partake in the digital distribution focused market and as Steam gets more users, less people buy hard copies of video games. Therefore, I can confidently say that the popularity of online distribution platforms like Steam, Origin, Uplay, and GoG.com is the one of the main reasons the revenue in US hard copy sales are plummeting.</p>
